# Synthetic Control Examples
Step by step Python code for applying synthetic control to interesting use cases

This repo will contain many examples for using the synthetic control method in diverse domains.
Meanwhile, these are the implemented examples:
1. [Estimating the Effect of Californiaâ€™s Tobacco Control Program (Abadie et al. 2010)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/11859)
    
    The relevant notebook is `Proposition99.ipynb` 
    
    Data sources for this use case are:
      - 'smoking.rda' taken from https://github.com/johnson-shuffle/mixtape/tree/master/data
      - 'prop99.csv' taken from https://github.com/jehangiramjad/tslib/tree/master/tests/testdata

    **The notebook goes through all preprocessing and processing steps to yields the figures just like in the original 2010 paper:**
